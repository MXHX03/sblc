                            recipient. This is
                            mostly used between exporters and importers to provide an assurance for payments for the
                            products or
                            goods provided. <br> <br>

                            Bank guarantee is a guarantee issued by a bank or a financial institute to reduce risks in
                            transactions for
                            both parties involved in the transactions in case of a contract breach. <br> <br>
                            In an event of a contractual obligation of the seller/ exporter or a payment obligation to
                            the seller/
                            importer, the bank or the financial institute guarantees to indemnify the recipient against
                            the
                            contractual obligations of the exporter or the importer. With this, the risk factor will be
                            reduced
                            drastically for both parties in a contractual agreement while encouraging the transaction to

                            <span class="text-primary"> What is a Bank draft? </span><br>
                            A bank draft is a payment instrument that guarantees the funds by your financial
                            institution. It also is
                            known as a banker’s cheque. In simple terms obtaining a bank draft is similar to asking your
                            bank to
                            write a cheque for you. The draft will enable you to make payments without having to
                            withdraw money
                            from your account. <br> <br> Here the bank will transfer the amount to an account of the
                            bank issuing you the
                            bank draft which the receiver of the money can use to collect money with. With this, the
                            receiver won’t
                            experience check bounces due to lack of funds in the account.

                            <br>
                            Documentary Letter of Credit is an assurance provided by a bank or trade finance
                            institutions to ensure the
                            importer/buyer, that they receive the goods under the terms and conditions as initially set
                            out and
                            payment to the supplier as pre-agreed. It is ideal for meeting short-term needs and for new
                            business
                            relationships. <br> <br> The bank or the financial institution will act as an intermediator

                            terms specified in the DLC are completely fulfilled to receive the payment. In an event of

                            buyer is unable to pay after the terms specified in the DLC are fulfilled, seller/exporter
                            can make a
                            compliant document presentation demanding payment, to which the bank or financial

                            <br>

                            supplier or
                            the contractor. It’s an on-demand bond, where the bondsman is bind to pay the amount of
                            money set
                            out in the bond immediately on demand, without having to meet any preconditions in the
                            contract.

                            statement is based on facts and doesn’t make the bank obligated to any financial commitment.

                            Business loans for growth usually involve borrowing larger sums of money to help with the costs of growing or developing a business.
                            <br><br>
                            The rate of interest payable is determined by current market rates and the business’ creditworthiness. Where the lender perceives higher risk of default, likely that the interest rate will also be high to reflect this.
                            <br><br>
                            There are many sources of business growth loans including banks, local authorities, regional investment initiatives, venture capital and fintech. It is important when considering which lender to go with, to ensure that the loans are affordable (ie: can you make the loan repayments over the term) and that the lender is aligned with your repayment plans (ie: if you plan to be able to repay the loan early, can you do this without penalty and will you have to pay the whole loan interest regardless).

                            One of the fastest-growing areas of funding, development finance can often appear complex. Developments can range from land purchases and ground upbuilds, through to heavy and light refurbishments and mezzanine loans.

                            Invoice financing is a general term to describe a range of asset-based finance facilities, whereby businesses sell their invoices to a lender for a percentage of their value. An invoice finance facility is a finance facility provided by an invoice finance provider to help business owners leverage their unpaid invoices in order to provide an instant cash injection into the business.
